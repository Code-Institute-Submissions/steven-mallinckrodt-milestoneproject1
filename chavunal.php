                        Only finding about this plane just recently, The Bad Company does not have a great understanding about this plane.
                        Planeshifted by the leader of The Cult of the Beginning, known as The Pale One, The Bad Company found themselves in a very alien place.
                        After arriving, The Pale One told them to learn and discover as much as they can about this world. And by doing so, bolster their power and the power of Nephalyr.
                        From what they have gathered, this plane is home to a great assortment of creatures. All with a monstrous form.
                        Though to their surprise, very civilised. Until now they have only seen a very accepting culture.
                        But, very cautious with humans. Humans in this world are spoken of as demons or destroyers.
                        And through their journey, the Bad Company has picked up a few hints as to why.
                        Apparently the plane of Nephalyr is not the only world who are haunted by the Towers of Infis.
                        But instead of monsters, denizens of Nephalyr inhabit these towers, wreaking havoc and chaos whenever they find a way out of the Tower.

                        As the party gets to know more of this place, the world will change with their actions. How will these adventurers act?
