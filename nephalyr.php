                        One of the civilised planes. This plane is called Nephalyr.
                        The continent, named after the plane, is divided by three lands.
                        <li>
                            <ul>Cormir, the kingdom of Man.</ul>
                            <ul>The Orcish Empire</ul>
                            <ul>The Elven Lands</ul>
                        </li>
                    </p>

                    <h2>Cormir </h2>
                    <p>
                        The kingdom of Man. In control of the Western Serpent Sea and the Northern Mountains.
                        Ruled by King Von Cormirim, whose palace is resides in the capital city, Citaheim.
                        The main military, The Hunters Army, is the main defense of the country.
                        Mostly working towards taking down the dungeons, also named The Towers of Infis, after the great wizard Leyla Infis, who first discovered these strange anomalies.
                        Cormir has a good relationship with the Elven Lands. Working together with the Elves and the Dwarves. They try to take down as many towers as possible. Gaining wealth and power with it.
                    </p>

                    <h2>The Elven Lands</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Elven Lands, also known as Taunoirin in the Elven tongue, does not have a form of hierarchy.
                        Made out of a lot of villages banded together with a grand counsil made up out of village elders.
                        This makes most decisions the Elves make a slow process. Though their life is much longer than that of any other race on Nephalyr.
                        This makes up for their indecision to call for action. Keeping the Wildlands at bay, helping Cormir and butting heads with the Orcish empire, the Elves always seem to have a lot of responsibilities.
                    </p>

                    <h2>The Orcish Empire</h2>
                    <p>
                        Their homeland is a desolate place. A great desert occupies the most of this grand empire their lands. Because of the lack of natural recources, the Orcs became a warmongering race.
                        Rellishing in battle and massacre, the Orcs enslave any whom they deem worth the trouble. Many Dwarves live in slavery under the oppressive reign of the Orcs.
                        But not much is known about them. One of the newest races found on Nephalyr, there are still a lot of mysteries surrounding these strange lands.

                    </p>

                    <h2>The Wildlands</h2>
                    <p>
                        On the south end of this continent a magical forest, named by many, The Wildlands, is a place where a lot of planes collide.
                        Slivers of the Feywild, Underdark, The Elemental Choas are found here. Only adventures of great renown go into The Wildlands.
                        Even then, most of them never return. Therefore not much is known about these strange lands.
